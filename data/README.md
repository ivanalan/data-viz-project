> This folder contains the five different data sets available for P5. You must choose one of these to visualize for your assignment. The five available data sets come from five different sources on the web. When available, it is helpful to know the pedigree of the data - what do the data attributes mean? Why was it collected in the first place? Who collected the data? This info should help when making design decisions about your visualization. Note that the datasets are not in the original state from the source - we have removed data elements and attributes to make the data sets more manageable for the project. Please check the following links for more info on the datasets:

### Aircraft incidents

This data set contains information about airplane mishaps that have occurred. These might be plane crashes or they could be more minor accidents that happened to a plane. Each data case (row) is an incident. Fields of the data set include date, location, airline, type of plane, phase of the flight, severity, fatalities, and so on.

### Candy

This data set summarizes a survey of people about different types of candies. Each data case (row) is a different person’s response. The attributes include demographics of the person, and they also include a column for each of the different types of candy. People’s ratings of the candy come from a nominal (`joy`, `meh`, `despair`) rating.

### Colleges

This data set provides a great deal of information about many colleges and universities in the U.S. Each data case (row) is a different school.
